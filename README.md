# Probabilistic and Nonlinear Compressive Sensing

This repository contains experimental implementations and analysis code for research on probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing methods in neural network training.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main experimental directories:

### l2-experiments/

Contains code for investigating the _ℓ₂-distance rebound phenomenon_, where student networks initially approach but then progressively diverge from teacher network parameters during training, even while improving functionally.

See [`l2-experiments/README.md`](l2-experiments/README.md) for detailed setup instructions and experiment configuration.

### EGP/
_(Coming Soon)_

## Getting Started

Each experimental directory is designed to be used as an independent root for running experiments:

1. __For ℓ₂-experiments__: Navigate to `l2-experiments/` and follow the setup instructions in its README
2. __For EGP experiments__: Navigate to `EGP/` and follow the setup instructions in its README
